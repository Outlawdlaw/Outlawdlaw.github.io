## About Me

My name is Dillan Lawless and I currently work as the Lead XR Developer at the Accenture Liquid Studio in South Africa. I have over two and a half years of professional Unity experience, along with some UE4, and have developed programs for various VR, MR, AR, and mobile devices - as well as desktop, of course.

## Code Snippets

The items listed below may or may not be complete scripts or projects due to the nature of my current work contract.

### Exploded View

I created this after seeing the Unreal Engine Product Viewer Template - we needed something similar but for Unity. It's fairly basic, and the system can be improved, but it got the job done at the time.

### Input Field Validation System

This group of scripts ensures that the user types in the correct information as per the type designated to the InputField. It's not complex, but it's definitely a necessity for log in and sign up pages within applications. This was done for a mobile app with Augmented Reailty functionality, among other things.
